# Shadowsocks Setup Guide for Windows

## About Shadowsocks
>* Shadowsocks is an open-source encrypted proxy project, Typically, the client software will open a socks5 proxy on the machine it is run, which internet traffic can then be directed towards, similarly to an SSH tunnel.
>* Shadowsocks uses a self-designed protocol for secure communications. The encryption algorithms include AES, Blowfish, IDEA, and RC4. No handshaking is needed except for creating a TCP connection. Each request only forwards one connection and does not need to maintain the state of “always connected”, so it is relatively power-efficient on mobile devices. All traffic is algorithmically encrypted, allowing you to choose your own algorithm.
>* Clients are available on multiple major operating systems and platforms, including Windows, OSX, Android, Linux, and iOS systems and routers (OpenWrt).

## System Requirements
**Before you install, always make sure that your system meets the minimum system requirements.**

You need Windows 7 SP1 or later to run Shadowsocks. If your operating system is older, upgrade to Windows 7 SP1 or later.

## Attention
* **Global mode** means that most of the traffic in the computer will go through a proxy, and it is not recommended for daily use, because it will easily let the torrent downloads through our proxy, and causing a **serious consequence** by receiving ISP complaints.

* **Load Balance** and **High Availability** are used to spread traffic and improve usability. It is **not** for speeding up yor internet. If a node has better connection quality, it is recommended to select that server directly.

* It is recommended to use **PAC** mode, which allows automatic proxy and access to non-blocked websites without proxying. (But in the Shadowsocks Win 2.x version, the built-in GFWList link has expired, causing the PAC regulations cannot be updated.)

* You can choose to download the PAC file from our website, or when you encounter a website that cannot be accessed, edit the local PAC file to add that website address.
